# AutoML
An streamlit based application to swiftly work on your data, creating various graphs and creating the best model for classification (or regression purposes). It uses PyTorch to train data on different models and gives out the most suitable ones by comparing their MSE, RMSE, R2 and other values.

To run this app on your local server, just install all the requirement files and you're almost done.

Step 1: 
    Download the zip file of this project in your system and after extraction, open the file with your code editor ( I prefer PyCharm)

Step 2:
    Open terminal and type this command:
    All the requirements will be installed at once but it will take some time to download.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3:
    Open terminal and type this command:
    
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py

AND NOW YOUR MACHINE LEARNING GOES BRRRR....


# NOTE: The best_model.pkl and sourcedata.csv are actually not a part of the app, but these are for your reference so as to what the final project file structure would look like. You'll have to use your own sourcedata for ML purpose. 

Happy MACHINE learning :)
